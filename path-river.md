# ðŸŒŠ Toward the River

You walk toward the sound of rushing water and find a crystal-clear river flowing gently. It's peaceful â€” too peaceful. A wooden boat is tied to a tree root, bobbing quietly in the current.

You kneel to drink, but the water feels oddly warm. A chill runs down your spine.

Something just moved under the surface.
