# ðŸ§­ The Compass Trail

You follow the trail the compass pointed to. The path is narrow and winding, and strange symbols begin to appear on the trees. Suddenly, the compass glows, and the ground beneath you trembles.

Before you can react, the forest shifts around you â€” the trail disappears, replaced by an open clearing filled with ancient stones. Youâ€™re no longer where you were.

The compass dims. The forest is silent.

_What just happened?_
