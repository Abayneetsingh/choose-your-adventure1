# ðŸŒ³ Climbing the Tree

You scale the tallest tree nearby. From the top, the endless forest spreads in all directions. In the far distance, you spot something glowing â€” maybe a building? But then, a strange wind rises and the branch beneath you creaks loudly.

You barely manage to cling on as the branch snaps, sending leaves fluttering to the ground. Miraculously, youâ€™re still holding on.

You breathe hard, adrenaline pumping. The forest suddenly feels more alive â€” and more dangerous.
