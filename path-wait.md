# ⏳ Waiting in the Forest

You sit on a mossy log and decide to wait. Time passes. The sounds of the forest fade. A heavy fog begins to roll in around you.

Suddenly, you hear footsteps — not one, but many. Soft. Unhurried. Getting closer.

You rise to your feet, heart pounding.

Then… silence.

You're no longer alone.
