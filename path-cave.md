# 🕳️ The Cave Entrance

You part the vines and peer into the darkness. It smells of damp earth and something else... older. As your eyes adjust, you see carvings on the wall — symbols you don’t understand, but feel strangely drawn to.

You step inside. The cave hums, like it’s alive. You take one more step.

And the entrance vanishes behind you.
