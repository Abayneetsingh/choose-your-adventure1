# ðŸŒ² The Forest of Forgotten Paths

You wake up in a dense forest, the sunlight barely piercing through the thick canopy above. There's a damp chill in the air, and the only sounds are birds and something... else. You don't remember how you got here, but in your hand is a strange compass that doesnâ€™t point north.

As you stand, the compass spins wildly and finally stops â€” pointing toward a narrow trail leading into the trees. Around you are five paths, each seeming to whisper promises of danger and discovery.

What do you do next?

1. [Follow the trail the compass points to.](path-compass.md)  
2. [Climb a nearby tree to get a better view.](path-tree.md)  
3. [Head toward the sound of running water.](path-river.md)  
4. [Investigate a cave entrance hidden behind vines.](path-cave.md)  
5. [Sit down and wait â€” maybe help will find you.](path-wait.md)
